# Hello, world ðŸ‘‹

My name is Pandu Supriyono. I'm a web developer born and bred in The Hague, the Netherlands but now
left my hometown to live in Utrecht. I am particularly interested in developing critical insights
with regards to digital technology and its role in society. Given this, I do my
best to contribute to a fair, inclusive and positive World Wide Web in the code
I bring out to the world.

## Maintenant...

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently developing new citizen services for the Embassy of the Republic of Indonesia and creating new digital identities for Stichting Ozanam, a non-profit organization tasked with tackling social and psycho-social issues in my home city of The Hague
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently busy launching a small web development studio called __Opinionated__
- ðŸ“– I'm currently learning TypeScript as well as Scala 
- ðŸ†• I recently found a love for JAMstack and made a [starter project to bootstrap 11ty projects](https://lunetten.dev)
- ðŸŽ¸ I play (synth) bass in an Utrecht-based new wave band and a Delft-based jazz fusion quartet
